      "Choose a task you want to work on",
      "Set a timer for 25 minutes (one 'pomodoro')",
      "Work on the task until the timer rings",
      "Take a short 5-minute break",
      "Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break"
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Keep a distraction list nearby to jot down interrupting thoughts",
